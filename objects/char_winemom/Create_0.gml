alibi = "Where were you when Jacob was in the bathroom?^Funny story actually, you’ll love this, I was inside preparing to watch my weekend workout when I spilled my mom fuel on our new rug! So once I fueled up I spent all my Saturday preparing to clean the rug instead! I was so preoccupied with the cleaning and the workout and the fueling that I didn’t even notice Little Jakey come back inside! I did tell him not to leave his juice unattended, but y’know, boys will be boys!!"
dialogue = "Who’s idea was it for Jacob to sell lemonaid?^It was little Jakey’s *hiccup*, he says its to save up money to buy himself a bike! He kept asking me for one, and I kept forgetting, just mom things, but Jakey did a fine job setting up shop, it’s a shame someone ruined his fun and took his apples or whatever! "
