alibi = "Did you shoot shoot Yorven Robes?^Brother, I’m about to be real honest with you, I don’t even know how I ended up in this city. I'm completely isolated from my crew. Last time I checked, I was on the battlefield, trying to get a tactical advantage over our adversaries. I guess I walked too far. I also left my gun on the battlefield, which is probably why I ran so far away. "
dialogue = "You just came from a battlefield? Are you sure you haven’t lost your marbles?^I know how it sounds, but Hollywood is a big place! I’m an extra in the new movie about the guy with a hole in his chest! Bullet Barry! Well, that’s its shooting name at least. We just wrapped up a tie in ad with some sugary movie theater candy, but I’ll be back at the studio next week."
