When the kid came back I said \”Hey kid, where’s all the lemonaid?\” but that weenie burst into tears and ran inside! Then I had to drive all the way back to campus with a dry mouth. Only in East Cundleham, I swear."
dialogue = "Why were your mouths so dry?^Uhhh, pretty sure I can’t answer that in a police station. Lets just say we were at a pretty lame party that ran out of drinks, which only made things worse. The frat that was hosting it burns too bright for their britches. Come to Alpha Sig for a real party. "
