I was at the kid’s juice stand just before he went into the bathroom, a beginners mistake unfortunately but a mistake nonetheless! Oh well, now he’ll know for next time, right! And knowledge is power afterall!"
//dialogue = "Who else did you see before Jacob ran to the bathroom?^Brilliant question, my friend! The Smartboy see’s a lot indeed! I saw two brilliant suns on such a blessed day, as well as a gentleman who smelled like flowers! I saw a woman crying through the kitchen window, and I saw a tired stereotype making himself miserable by nitpicking a beautiful day! Ho ho ho, isn’t being observant the greatest?"
