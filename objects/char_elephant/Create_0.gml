Western Chester is friend of mine, you see, let me use his basement to improve my technology with the help of my business partner, The Fidgeter. I did hear quite a ruckus goingson upstairs.

dialogue = "How long have you been working under Western Chester's? ^Ever since my release from the slammer. I am a man with a criminal history, is why they suspect me to be involved. Many years a go, a masked menace sent me to maximum security off the coast of big city. Chester has been like brother to me, brother that charge rent, but brother no less. Chester recently tell me trouble with new hire, he go on and on about my motherland and the youth of current state of his country. He draw parallel, spouting on and on about workers revolution. I tell him just pay her more, but Chester is stubborn. I keep my mouth shut and keep my secret underground lab."
