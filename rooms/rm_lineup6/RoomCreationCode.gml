global.testimony = "Jacob Shaibly was looking forward to selling lemonade in his front yard (without a permit but weâ€™ll ignore that) on a sunny saturday afternoon in the east cundleham suburbs. Unfortunately for Jacob, he took a quick bathroom break and came back to find all his lemonade (and most of his lemons) were missing! Luckily there was a neighborhood party and a soccer game going on, so we had plenty of folks to choose for this lineup. The doorbell cam file got corrupted, so all we know is that the perp had glasses."
