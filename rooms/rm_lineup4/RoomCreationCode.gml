global.testimony = "Someone set fire to the Playground Number 17, a popular after school hangout spot for for the Flembis County Middle School kids. Everything burned to the ground except the metal slide, which no one liked, lets be honest. This lineup consists of locals in the area who we suspect may have had something to do with it. All that was recovered from the scene was a single match. Sources say the fire took place around 9 - 10pm on Saturday."
