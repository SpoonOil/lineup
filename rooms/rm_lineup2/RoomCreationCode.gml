global.testimony = "A heated brawl took place at Western Chester's, a bar famous for its \"unique\" crowd of patrons. When all was said in done, there was over $14,000 dollars worth of property damage,but Western Chester himself says he doesn't care about any of that, he just wants to find the person responsible for destroying his first dollar, which was hanged safely over the main counter for the past 35 years. We've captured some of the patrons that were there last night, someone here has to be responsible."
